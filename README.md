## Key Features of listener AI

- **Performance Analyzer**: After each recorded call, listener AI captures and analyzes all aspects of the conversation, providing actionable insights for improvement. Key feedback includes:
  - **Areas for Improvement**: Identifies specific aspects of your responses that could be improved.
  - **Strengths**: Highlights what the you did well during the call, reinforcing positive actions.
  - **Self-Reflection**: Provides insights into the your strong and weak points, helping them evaluate their performance.
  - **Caller’s Hidden Emotions**: Analyzes and uncovers the hidden intent of the person you are talking to, offering a deeper understanding of the emotional context.
  - **Scorecards**: Provides detailed scorecards that assess the your performance across different metrics, helping track progress over time.

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Offers continuous feedback during a call or after the conversation, ensuring you are always learning and improving.

- **Continuous Improvement**: The system’s feedback loop ensures that you receive ongoing guidance, fostering skill growth and better decision-making under pressure.
